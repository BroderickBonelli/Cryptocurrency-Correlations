# Cryptocurrency-Correlations
Here I calculate the 30 day correlations of closing prices among the top layer 1 protocols and ERC 20 tokens using python and jupyter notebook. I then visualize the correlation matrix using Seaborn. This is useful for liquidity providers as it is best to provide liquidity on highly correlated pairs to minimize the risk of impermanent loss.
